# lncity-api

This is the API that serves the Lightning City website.

The code is not very friendly at this point.
There's also some lack of standard in the way some things are done. I'm honestly a bit clumsy...
Any feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated, mostly to make it easy to test out.

# Website

You can find the website code here:

# Live Version

You can experiment with the end result here:

https://ln.city

# Vulnerabilities

I tried protecting the server agains't most vulnerabiliies I could think of.
By analysing the code it's likely that some are found, please disclose them instead of stealing all the funds from my live node! Thanks
